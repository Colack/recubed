        - Add a CubeDood ReCubed demo for the 8th graders at Tri-Tech to play.
            Due Date: Assuming 3/14 atm. May be a different time.

            This demo will include:
                - 40 levels for the kids to try.
                - A working version of the level editor.
                - A sneak peak of the final boss.
                - A cutscene explaining the game with CubeDood explaining how he moves.

            "demo" on the title screen, you will be redirected to the demo version of the game.
