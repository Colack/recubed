    Developer Note:
            Hello CubeDoods! Colack here. Thanks for playing CubeDood in "The Memory Snatcher", and now, CubeDood: ReCubed!
            I first want to apologize for the huge mess that was Celia Project, and the let-down of CubeDood vs The World
            being cancelled. I'm sorry about the rushed due-dates, the failed goals, and overall the cancellation of a
            game that was supposed to be CubeDood vs The World. I created this game to reboot CubeDood, and to add some
            of the content that was going to be included in CubeDood vs The World. This includes the editor, the cool graphics
            library, the updated soundtrack, and much more.

            I feel like the CubeDood: ReCubed development team works really well together, and we might be working on more projects
            in the future, but we will not announce anything at all until we have a good working version of the game up. Thanks for
            sticking with me as I change through different periods of development with different teams. Thanks for understanding some
            of the problems of game development and how it can change the developers thoughts on the game. I was really burnt out
            after getting a basic version of CubeDood vs The World working, and that's why I took my really long break from 
            game development. I hope that this game meets all your expectations of what a newer version of CubeDood would be like,
            especially with my updated knowledge of the game engine and how I can improve on code and development.

            Will CubeDood return? Who knows. CubeDood may be back in a new adventure soon, or he may have to wait another year
            for more content to appear. I won't be announcing anything anytime soon, as once CubeDood: ReCubed gets released
            I will take a month break from game development overall to work on myself. Don't worry though, I will still be working
            on more games and more projects, and I'm not planning on stopping anytime soon.

            So I guess I should say instead, CubeDood will return. CubeDood will be back in a new adventure, meaning CubeDood will
            return.

            Thanks,
                - Jack
